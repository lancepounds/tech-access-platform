This file may have previously contained route definitions
or other main application logic.

Based on recent review, route definitions, especially for the 'main' blueprint,
are primarily managed in 'app/main/routes.py'.

Any specific application setup or global handlers that might belong here
should be evaluated. If this file becomes empty, it might be a candidate
for removal or restructuring, depending on the project's overall design.

For now, it's cleared of redundant route definitions.

# Imports that might be needed if this file serves other purposes later:
# from flask import Blueprint
# from flask_login import login_required, current_user
# from app.models import Event
# from app.main.routes import main_bp # If main_bp needed for other setup here

# Placeholder if this file is expected to exist by other parts of the app,
# or if it's intended for future use (e.g., app factory pattern).

    This is a placeholder. If app/main.py is essential for the application's
    structure but currently has no active code after refactoring,
    this ensures the file is not entirely empty.
    It can be removed if the file itself is deemed unnecessary.
